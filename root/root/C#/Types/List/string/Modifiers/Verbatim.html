     <h1>Verbatim</h1>

    <p>Verbatim strings are useful when one needs to use special characters,
      like backslashes. Usually, <code>\n</code> would be interpreted as a new
      line. On a verbatim string, however, it isn't.</p>
    <p>Verbatim strings are prefixed with an <code>@</code> sign:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-csharp">string path = "c:\\\Users";
string path_verb = @"c:\\Users";

// Note that the first string needs an extra backslash as an escape character.</code></pre>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>One can create new lines on verbatim strings by literally skipping a line.</p>
