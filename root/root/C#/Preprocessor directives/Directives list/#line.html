     <h1>#line</h1>

    <p>The <code>#line</code> directive lets one modify the line number that will
      be shown on the compiler in case of errors/ warnings. It can optionally
      modify the file name as well. The syntax is <code>#line [number] [file name]</code> (e.g <code>#line 10 “script”</code>).</p>
    <p>Notice that, after a <code>#line</code> directive, the following lines will
      continue to be incremented normally - unless there's another <code>#line</code> directive.</p>
    <p>Finally, be aware that <code>#line default</code> returns the line counting
      to the “real counting" and <code>#line hidden</code> hides the line from
      the debugger.</p>
