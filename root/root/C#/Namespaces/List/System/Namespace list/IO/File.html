     <h1>File</h1>

    <p>The same as <a href="FileInfo.html"><code>FileInfo</code></a> but all methods
      are static.</p>
    <p>Useful when one needs to manipulate a single file. Be aware that security
      checks are made on every action, whereas when using <code>FileInfo</code> objects,
      security checks are made only once, on the object's construction.</p>
