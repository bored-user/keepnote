     <h1>Variables</h1>

    <p>Variables, in C#, are case sensitive. Which means that <code>Variable</code> is
      not the same as <code>variable</code>.</p>
    <p>When it's necessary to create a variable which has the same name as a
      reserved keyword (e.g a variable named <code>int</code>), it's convention
      to add a <code>@</code> sign at the beginning of the variable name.</p>
    <p>Finally, variables in C# follow the camelCase syntax.</p>
