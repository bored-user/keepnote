      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>rect() is used to draw a rectangle on a canvas. It takes at least four
          arguments: the x-axis and y-axis position of the rectangle, it's width
          and it's height. It can also take some optional arguments: the rectangle
          border radius. One can give from 1 to 4 border-radius parameters. The first
          defines the top-left, the 2nd, the top-right; then the bottom-right and
          bottom-left. If you pass less than 4 parameters, the other borders will
          have the default radius value (0). Quick note: the 0x0 point on webpages
          is the top-left corner.</p>
