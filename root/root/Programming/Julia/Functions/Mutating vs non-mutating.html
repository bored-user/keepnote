     <h1>Mutating vs non-mutating</h1>

    <p>Mutation functions are the ones which changes (or alters) their arguments.
      By convention they're written using an exclamation mark at the end.
      <br>
      <br>Examples of that are push!() and pop!(). There are many functions in Julia
      which have both a mutating and a non mutating version (e.g <code>sort</code> and <code>sort!</code>)</p>
