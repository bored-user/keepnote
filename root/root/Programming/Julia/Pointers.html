     <h1>Pointers</h1>

    <p>Just like on JavaScript, Julia stores, in a variable, a pointer to an
      object in memory. So, if one sets a variable "x" to variable "y" which
      has an object assign to it, Julia won't copy the whole object again. In
      fact, it'll only create another pointer to that object in memory. In order
      to really copy an object, one must use the copy() function.
