     <h1>Julia</h1>

    <p>Julia is a programming language focused on speed and runtime.
      <br />It is designed to handle scientific research.
      <br />
      <br />Now, some technical details: There's no need to add a semicolon at the
      end of a line (although it's allowed). A single line comment is done by
      using a hashtag. A multi-line comment is created using #= (to open) and
      =# (to close it).</p>
