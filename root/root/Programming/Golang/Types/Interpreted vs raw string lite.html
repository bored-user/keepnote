     <h1>Interpreted vs raw string literal</h1>

    <p>In Go, there are two string literals: the interpreted and the raw.</p>
    <p>The only difference between them is that the interpreted string literal
      (enclosed by double quotes) is interpreted by the compiler - meaning that
      it's possible to use special characters like <code>\n</code> and escape sequences
      like <code>\"</code> -, while the raw string literal (enclosed in backticks)
      are displayed as written.</p>
