     <h1>Exported vs Unexported identifiers</h1>

    <p>Every identifier in a package that starts with a capital letter is exported
      - meaning that it's available outside of that package; while every identifier
      starting with a lower case is local to that package.</p>
    <p>Be aware that, by convention, every exported method must contain a comment
      right above it (starting with the method name) stating what it does, like
      so:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-go">package pkg1

// Sum() gets two integers and returns their sum
func Sum(n1 int, n2 int) int {
	return n1 + n2
}</code></pre>
