     <h1>char arrays</h1>

    <p><code>char</code> arrays are special because of its properties. First,
      it is the only type of array that can be directly printed to the terminal
      using <code>std::cout</code> (displayed as a string).</p>
    <p>Before explaining further, I must define <code>C string</code>: it is an
      array of characters ending in a <code>NULL</code> terminator (<code>\0</code>).&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Furthermore, there are some nuances that must be considered:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>char message[2] { ‘h’, ‘i' };</code> - not considered a C string</li>
      <li><code>char message[3] { ‘h’, ‘i’ };</code> - &nbsp;is a C string (notice
        that it was initialized with 3 elements, however only two were given. Because
        of that, the compiler will add a NULL terminator at the end)</li>
      <li><code>char message[] { ‘h’, ‘i’ };</code> - not a C string (the array is
        initialized automatically with the numbers of elements it was given. Because
        of that, this case gets converted into the first case)</li>
      <li><code>char message[3] { ‘h’, ‘i’, ‘\0’ };</code> - is a C string because
        it ends explicitly with a NULL terminator</li>
      <li><code>char message[] { “hi” };</code> - is a C string because the compiler
        will add the NULL terminator automatically; notice the <code>"hi"</code>,
        instead of <code>'hi'</code>.</li>
    </ul>
