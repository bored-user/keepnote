     <h1>signed vs unsigned</h1>

    <p>A signed number has a sign (positive or negative). That means that half
      of the capacity of the number type will be used to store negative numbers.</p>
    <p>Unsigned numbers, on the other hand, may store only positive values (including
      zero).</p>
    <p>Note that integer-types (<code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>short</code>,
      etc) are signed by default.</p>
