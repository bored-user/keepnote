     <h1>Sealed</h1>

    <p>Sealed classes are the opposite of <a href="Abstract.html">abstract classes</a>:
      they prevent inheritance. It's also possible to declare sealed methods
      - which cannot be overridden.</p>
    <p>Note that only <a href="../Modifiers/override.html"><code>override</code></a> methods
      can be sealed.</p>
    <p>A sealed class is slightly faster than a ordinary class because of some
      run-time optimizations made by CLR.</p>
