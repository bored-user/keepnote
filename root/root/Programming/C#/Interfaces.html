     <h1>Interfaces</h1>

    <p>Interfaces are like contracts which classes must follow. They are, in
      a sense, very similar to <a href="Classes/Abstract.html">abstract classes</a> -
      but have some key differences:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a class can only inherit from one class but can implement multiple interfaces</li>
      <li>interface names start with <code>I</code> and the name of the interface
        in camel case (e.g <code>IMyInterface</code>)</li>
      <li>a abstract class is, by name, a class - while an interface is only a contract</li>
      <li>all methods in interfaces must be declared in classes that implement it</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The only bad side of interfaces is that they require a lot of work to
      be changed, since every method on an interface must be declared on the
      class that's implementing it - while abstract classes do not. Generally,
      there's a tendency to favour abstract classes over interfaces.</p>
    <p>Finally, a good way to know whether one needs an interface or an abstract
      class is to know if there's a <code>is-a</code> relationship between the
      classes (in which case one should use an abstract class) or a <code>can-do</code> relationship
      (in which case interfaces are preferred).</p>
