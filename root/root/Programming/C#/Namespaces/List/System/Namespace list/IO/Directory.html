     <h1>Directory</h1>

    <p>The same as <a href="DirectoryInfo.html"><code>DirectoryInfo</code></a> but
      all methods are static.</p>
    <p>Useful when one needs to manipulate a single directory. Be aware that
      security checks are made on every action, whereas when using <code>DirectoryInfo</code> objects,
      security checks are made only once, on the object's construction.</p>
