     <h1>Why</h1>

     <h2>Why?</h2>

    <p>Generics are the solution to a problem that existed: when one wanted to
      create, say a List of object <code>X</code>, he needed to create a <code>XList</code>.
      If it was, later, necessary to create a List of object <code>Y</code>, a <code>YList</code> had
      to be designed. One of the attempts to solve this problem was to create
      one single <code>List</code> class which encapsulated an <a href="../Types/List/object.html"><code>object</code></a> array
      - since <code>object</code> is the base class for all other classes. However,
      the <a href="../Types/Boxing%20and%20Unboxing.html"><code>boxing</code> and <code>unboxing</code></a> that
      had to be made affected performance. Later, the <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> generics
      notation was created and is used until this day.</p>
