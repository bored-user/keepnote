       <h1>Query</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>One should first set the SQL query and then use it on a <code>$stmt</code> variable,
          like:</p>
        <p>
          <br><code>$stmt = $this-&gt;connect()-&gt;query($sql); // where $this referes to the connect function set on the database class which was extended to the currently working class.</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          <br>And then use a <code>$stmt-&gt;fetch()</code> or <code>$stmt-&gt;fetchAll()</code> to
          get the result accordingly.
          <br>
          <br>Using prepared statements (when there's user input):
          <br><code>$stmt = $this-&gt;connect()-&gt;prepare($sql);</code>
          <br><code>$stmt-&gt;execute(["item 1", "item 2"]); // in this case, the SQL query will have some "blanks" that need to be filled. Every time there's a blank, one should use the question mark as a placeholder. Example: $sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = ? AND id = ?"; The first array item will indicate the value of the name row, while the second item will indicate the value of the id row, and so on.</code>
          <br>
          <br>This will also works on INSERT queries (need to use prepared statements
          for security).</p>
