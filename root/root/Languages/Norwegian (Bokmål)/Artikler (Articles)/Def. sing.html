         <h2>Def. sing.</h2>

        <p>The definite singular form convention is the way of defining singular
          <a
          href="../Subsantiver%20(Nouns)">nouns</a>. It basically consist in adding the noun's article at its end,
            creating a new (definite) noun.</p>
        <p>For instance: “<a href="List/En.html">en</a>  <a href="../Subsantiver%20(Nouns)/People/en%20mann%20(a%20man)">mann</a>”
          means “a man”, while “mannen” means “the man”. There are, however, irregular
          definite nouns, like “<a href="List/En.html">en</a>  <a href="../Subsantiver%20(Nouns)/People/ei%20en%20jente%20(a%20girl)">jente</a>”
          ("a girl"), which becomes “jenta” ("the girl"), instead of “jenteen” (which
          would be the regular form).</p>
