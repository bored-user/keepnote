     <h1>Modules vs Packages</h1>

    <p>In Go, there are two very specific components: modules and packages. A
      package is a set of similar files. A module, on the other hand, is a set
      of packages. Usually, there's one (very often) or more modules per repository
      (GitHub repository, for example).</p>
    <p>Every go script must have a <code>package</code> directive, and at least
      one <code>package main</code> - since <code>main</code> is the script's entry
      point.</p>
