     <h1>Modules</h1>

    <p>Modules are like namespaces.</p>
    <p>Comparing a module with a class is like comparing apples with oranges.
      They aren't the same and aren't made for the same purpose. But the key
      differences between the two are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A class can be instantiated, a module cannot</li>
      <li>A class cannot contain another class, a module can</li>
      <li>One cannot access a class variable without instating it. But said thing
        is possible with modules.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It's, however, possible to "add" a module to a class. Said module may
      or may not overwrite the classes' methods.</p>
