     <h1>include</h1>

    <p><code>include</code> is used to add a module to a class. It turns the module's
      methods to instance methods, which means that one needs to instantiate
      a class before using said methods.</p>
    <p>Basically, when one uses <code>include</code>, it's like all the module's
      methods are class methods: one can call from within the class methods:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-ruby">module MyModule
	def say_hi
		'hi'
	end
end

class MyClass
	include MyModule
	
	def initialize
		puts say_hi
	end
end

cl = MyClass.new #=&gt; 'hi'</code></pre>
    <p>However, if there's a class method with the same name as the module method,
      the class method prevails. This can be changed using <a href="prepend.html"><code>prepend</code></a>.</p>
