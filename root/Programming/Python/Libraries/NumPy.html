        <p>Numpy is a python library to deal with scientific computations. Numpy
          is much faster than Python's built-in lists. That is because while Python
          stores a lot of information (bytes) for each item in a list, Numpy only
          needs to store the data itself. Besides that, in Numpy, the memory is always
          contiguous.</p>
