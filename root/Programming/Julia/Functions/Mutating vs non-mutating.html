        <p>Mutation functions are the ones which changes (or alters) their arguments.
          By convention they're written using an exclamation mark at the end.

          />
          <br />Examples of that are push!() and pop!(). There are many functions in Julia
          which have both a mutating and a non mutating version (e.g <code>sort</code> and <code>sort!</code>)</p>
