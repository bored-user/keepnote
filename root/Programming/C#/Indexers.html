       <h1>Indexers</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Indexers are a way to access <code>this</code> as if it was a <a href="Namespaces/List/System/Namespace%20list/Collections/Generic/Dictionary">Dictionary</a> or
          a <a href="Namespaces/List/System/Namespace%20list/Collections/Generic/List.html">List</a>.</p>
        <p>For instance, in my <a href="https://github.com/bored-user/MatrixMath/tree/a4e5ed29eb5ae0bea8b6509da2b35cd655a5ed8b">MatrixMath</a> project,
          I had to use a property inside <code>this</code> called <code>matrix</code>,
          while I could just have used an indexer, since the object itself was the
          matrix.</p>
        <p>Indexers are, in their essence, a very customized version of a getter
          and setter properties (read <a href="Property%20vs%20Field.html">here</a> and
          <a
          href="Modifiers/Access%20modifiers/Auto-implemented%20properties.html">here</a>for more info).</p>
        <p>The key here is to create a <a href="Modifiers/Access%20modifiers/public.html"><code>public</code></a> property
          named <code>this</code>:</p>
        <section class="include-note" data-note-id="XFPhXQTTBW2l"> </section>
        <p> </p>
        <p>In that example, I've used a <a href="Types/List/array/Multi-dimensional%20arrays.html">multi-dimensional array</a> as
          indexer; however, it's also possible to use strings, ints, etc. Note that
          an auto-implemented property cannot be used in this case.</p>
