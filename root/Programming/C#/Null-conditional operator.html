        <p>The null-conditional operator is the same as the optional chaining in
          JavaScript. It can stop a chaining of objects if one results in null.</p>
        <p>Its syntax is pretty simple:</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-csharp">class Program
{
	static void Main()
	{
		/*
			Suppose we have an Post object that
			may or may not have a "Description"
			property.
			
			`p1` is of type Post and HAS a description
			`p2` is the same as `p1` but it DOESN'T have a description
		*/
		
		Console.WriteLine(p1.Description) // "post desc"
		Console.WriteLine(p1.Description) // throws an exception
		Console.WriteLine(p1?.Description) // null
	}
