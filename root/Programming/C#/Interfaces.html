      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Interfaces are like contracts which classes must follow. They are, in
          a sense, very similar to <a href="Classes/Abstract.html">abstract classes</a> -
          but have some key differences:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a class can only inherit from one class but can implement multiple interfaces</li>
          <li>interface names start with <code>I</code> and the name of the interface
            in camel case (e.g <code>IMyInterface</code>)</li>
          <li>a abstract class is, by name, a class - while an interface is only a contract</li>
          <li>all methods in interfaces must be declared in classes that implement it</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The only bad side of interfaces is that they require a lot of work to
          be changed, since every method on an interface must be declared on the
          class that's implementing it - while abstract classes do not. Generally,
          there's a tendency to favour abstract classes over interfaces.</p>
        <p>Finally, a good way to know whether one needs an interface or an abstract
          class is to know if there's a <code>is-a</code> relationship between the
          classes (in which case one should use an abstract class) or a <code>can-do</code> relationship
          (in which case interfaces are preferred).</p>
