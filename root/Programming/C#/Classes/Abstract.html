        <p>Abstract classes are used to define something that's a base to other things.
          For instance, in a mathematical software, a shape could be defined as an
          abstract class - because there are shapes called triangles and circles
          but there's no shape called shape.</p>
        <p>In this sense,</p>
        <ul>
          <li>abstract classes cannot be instantiated</li>
          <li>if a method is declared as abstract, the whole class needs to be abstract
            as well</li>
          <li>a abstract class can contain, for instance, <a href="Static.html">static methods/ properties</a>

          </li>
          <li>a abstract class may contain not abstract methods - if it's the same for
            all implementations</li>
          <li>all abstract methods declared on an abstract class must also be defined
            on the derived class</li>
          <li>a abstract class a a way to force other developers to adopt your style,
            so to speak</li>
          <li>methods from a derived abstract class must use <code>override</code> to
            provide the methods' body</li>
        </ul>
