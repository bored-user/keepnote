       <h1>Sealed</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Sealed classes are the opposite of <a href="Abstract.html">abstract classes</a>:
          they prevent inheritance. It's also possible to declare sealed methods
          - which cannot be overridden.</p>
        <p>Note that only <a href="../Modifiers/override.html"><code>override</code></a> methods
          can be sealed.</p>
        <p>A sealed class is slightly faster than a ordinary class because of some
          run-time optimizations made by CLR.</p>
