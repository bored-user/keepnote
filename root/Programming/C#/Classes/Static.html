        <p>Static methods are a way of executing class methods without having to
          instantiate them. It also allows the system to store that method in only
          one place (because the class objects will only have a pointer to the method,
          not the method itself).</p>
        <p>They're useful when the method doesn't depend on the object (roughly speaking,
          it doesn't modify <code>this</code> variables).</p>
        <p>Note that properties can also be static (<code>private static int _id</code> -
          for example).</p>
        <p>Finally, it's possible - although not considered a best practice - to
          declare a static class. All methods and properties from a static class
          must also be static.</p>
        <p>It's useful to reference a value that will change. For instance, one can
          set the title of a window to a property of a static class and later change
          the value of the said property of said static class - there's no need to
          also change the title of the window.</p>
