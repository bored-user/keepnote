        <p>Python is an interpreted language, ran by the <code>python</code> command.
          One can also specify the shebang (<code>#!/bin/python</code>), which sets
          the path to Python's interpreter. If that's done, one doesn't need to call
          the <code>python</code> command on the terminal - it's possible to simply
          execute <code>./script.py</code> and the terminal will implicitly invoke <code>/bin/python</code>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Indentation is essential in the language. It does not make use of curly
          braces, but the interpreter can only run Python code if it's correctly
          indented - indicating which commands are part of which structure.</p>
