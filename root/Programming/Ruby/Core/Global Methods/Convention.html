        <p>According to Ruby convention rules, every method that has a question mark
          in it's name (e.g <code>include?</code>) returns a boolean.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Also, almost every ‘action method’ (e.g <code>sort</code>, <code>reverse</code>, <code>upcase</code>,
          etc) has a modifying (aka dangerous) and a non-modifying (aka non-dangerous)
          version. The modifying version modifies the data structure it was called
          on and has a <code>!</code> on its name (e.g <code>sort!</code>, <code>reverse!</code> and <code>upcase!</code>).
          While the non-modifying version doesn't has an exclamation mark on it and
          only returns a copy, a modified version of the data structure it was called
          on. However there are some methods (like <code>push</code>, <code>pop,</code>  <code>shift</code> and <code>unshift</code>)
          which <strong>do</strong> modify said data structure but <strong>don't</strong> include
          the bang in its name.</p>
