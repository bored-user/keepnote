        <p><code>read</code> is a method that can be called on the File object. It
          reads the file contents and returns it.</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-ruby">File.read('file')</code></pre>

        <p> </p>
        <p>It can be also called on a File instance and return the contents of the
          file.</p><pre><code class="language-text-x-ruby">f = File.new('file', 'r')
puts f.read</code></pre>

        <p> </p>
        <p>The difference between both methods is that the first can be called over
          and over on the same file, and it'll return its contents. The second, however,
          places the reading pointer at the end of the file, so it can only be called
          one time.</p>
