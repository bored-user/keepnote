       <h1>Modules</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Modules are like namespaces.</p>
        <p>Comparing a module with a class is like comparing apples with oranges.
          They aren't the same and aren't made for the same purpose. But the key
          differences between the two are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A class can be instantiated, a module cannot</li>
          <li>A class cannot contain another class, a module can</li>
          <li>One cannot access a class variable without instating it. But said thing
            is possible with modules.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's, however, possible to "add" a module to a class. Said module may
          or may not overwrite the classes' methods.</p>
