        <p>It is used to load class files automatically on demand. There must be
          a pattern on class paths (like class/className.class.php) in order to load
          it.
          <br>
          <br>Takes a function as parameter. This child function takes a parameter (the
          class name) and must have an include (or include_once) command in order
          to load the class file.
          <br>
          <br>Also, for error handling, it is possible to add a <code>if (!file_exists(classFile)) { return false; }</code> before
          the <code>include_once</code> command.
          <br>
          <br>The loading (child) function will also work for namespaces if the class
          is instanciated using <code>new NamespaceName\ClassName()</code>. There
          must also be a folder inside the class folder which has the same name as
          the namespace.
          <br>
          <br>In order to detect whether or not the function (child) is being executed
          from a file on the root folder or the includes folder, one must check if
          the <code>$_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"]</code> and <code>$_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"]</code> doesn't
          contain the keyword <code>includes</code>. If it does, the script must add
          "../" accordingly.
          <br>
          <br>Finally, one can use the "brute-force method": scan files inside class
          directory, using <code>scandir()</code> and run a for loop on those files,
          loading 'em all.</p>
