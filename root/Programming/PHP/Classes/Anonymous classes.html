        <p>Anonymous classes are classes that are deleted just after they're used.
          <br>They should be used when the class the programmer is creating does something
          very basic (or does only one thing, once), so that it isn't necessary to
          create a whole class just for that.
          <br>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Those created properties and methods can be accessed using the $obj object,
          just like in a normal class/ object. Quick note: if there's no constructor
          (__construct method) there's no use to the brackets after the class keyword.</p>
