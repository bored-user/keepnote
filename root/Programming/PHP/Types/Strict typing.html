       <h1 data-trilium-h1>Strict typing</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>One can specify the type of data which a function will recieve as argument,
          using the typename keyword, just like in C#. For instance, if a function
          can only get an integer as parameter, one may use <code>function func(int $arg) {}</code>.
          That means that PHP will throw an error if the data given isn't the specified
          one.
          <br>
          <br>Actually, there's something called strict declaration which will FORCE
          PHP to throw the error. In that integer example above, one may give "2"
          (which is technically a string) but PHP will convert it to an integer and
          won't throw any error.
          <br>
          <br>The same problem may also happen in the wanted data is a string but the
          user passes the number 4 as an argument. PHP will convert the integer "4"
          to the string "4".
          <br>
          <br>The programmer may avoid this by declaring strict_types predefined constant
          to 1, using <code>declare(strict_types = 1)</code>. This will not allow
          PHP to automatically convert data types (like the ones on the examples
          above).</p>
