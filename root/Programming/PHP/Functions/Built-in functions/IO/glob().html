        <p>glob() is a function used to find files matching a specific string. It
          takes the file name as its single parameter. In case it returns two results,
          the first will always be the right one. If one searches a file named "profile1.jpg"
          and there's another file named "profile11.jpg", glob will return an array
          which's first index is "profile1.jpg", which is the wanted one.</p>
