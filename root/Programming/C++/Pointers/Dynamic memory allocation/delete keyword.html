        <p>The <code>delete</code> keyword deletes a pointer.</p>
        <p>Note that it is in fact safe to execute <code>delete</code> on a pointer
          that's already <code>nullptr</code> - or rather, that hasn't been initialized.
          Therefore, there's no need to check if a pointer is not <code>nullptr</code> before
          calling <code>delete</code> on it.</p>
        <p>Also, after deleting a pointer, it is a good practice to reset it to <code>nullptr</code>;
          otherwise, it is left as a dangling pointer.</p>
        <p>The delete keyword may also delete dynamic allocated arrays: <code>delete[] dyn_arr;</code>
