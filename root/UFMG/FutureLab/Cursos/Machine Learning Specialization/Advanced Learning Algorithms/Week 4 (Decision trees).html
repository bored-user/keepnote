      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>Decision trees is a learning algorithm. It is used on classification tasks
          and works by using trees.</p>
        <p>A tree is a sequence of hierarchical nodes with a root and leaf nodes.
          The nodes on the decision tree are “splitting nodes”, which splits the
          dataset into sub-branches (one to the left and one to the right). Finally,
          the leaf nodes are the “answer” the model gives to the classification task.</p>
        <p>Decision trees work by splitting the dataset successively until a leaf
          node is found. The way the algorithm splits the data is by separating disjoint
          sets of the data in a “has”/ “not has” manner. For instance, the images
          which have the color orange go to the left, while those without it go to
          the right. Several of those divisions are done, until a leaf node is reached.</p>
