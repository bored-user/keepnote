       <h1 data-trilium-h1>Entropy as a measure of impurity</h1>

      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>In order to measure how much a set is pure/ impure, the entropy function
          is used.</p>
        <p>Suppose that in a dataset of cats and dogs, out of 100 examples, 10 are
          cats (what we're looking for). In that case, the ratio of “successes” is
          10/100. That set is far more “pure” than a set with 50/100 dogs and 50/100
          cats.</p>
        <p>Therefore intuitively, the entropy function should look kind of like a
          parabola, which has a peak in the middle and goes to zero on both ends.</p>
        <p>That's roughly what it is. The entropy function, H(p), is a function of
          the ratio of successes, p. <code>H(p) = -plog2(p) - (1-p)log2(1-p)</code>.
          That function describes the curve explained above.</p>
        <p>Note that if p is 1 or 0, there will be log2(0). In that case, although
          the log function isn't defined at x=0, it's a convention that the value
          the function takes at that point is 0.</p>
        <p>In the way that it's defined, H(p) outputs values between 0 and 1, where
          1 is worse (higher entropy, higher impurity) and 0 is best (lower entropy,
          lower impurity). The peak is at <code>H(½) = 1</code>.</p>
