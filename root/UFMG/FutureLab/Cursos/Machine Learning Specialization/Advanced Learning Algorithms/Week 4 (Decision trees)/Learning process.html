        <p>How to choose what features to split on at each node? On every step of
          the decision tree, the algorithm is looking for ways to maximize purity
          (or minimize impurity).</p>
        <p>And when to stop splitting? There are mainly four moments in which to
          stop splitting: when a node is 100% one class (e.g, when all data in a
          node are dogs/ cats); when splitting a node will result in the tree exceeding
          a maximum pre-determined depth; when improvements in purity score are below
          a given threshold; or when the number of data points in a node are below
          a given threshold.</p>
