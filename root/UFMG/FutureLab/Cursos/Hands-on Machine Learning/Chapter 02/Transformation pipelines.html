        <p>You can assemble several transformers into a pipeline, which runs them
          all automatically The. <code>sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline()</code> class does
          just that. It takes as input an array of tuples - the first element of
          the tuple must be a string with unique names without double underscores;
          the second element is the transformer itself.</p>
        <p>If you don't want to name all the elements of the pipeline, just call <code>sklearn.pipeline.make_pipeline()</code>.
          Each of its arguments is a element on the pipeline (the name of the element
          is its classname all lowercase).&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If the last estimator of the pipeline is a predictor, there's a <code>.predict()</code> method
          on the pipeline itself, which runs <code>.transform()</code> on all estimators
          and pass the result as input to the predictor. Then, it returns the output
          of the predictor as its own.</p>
        <p>If on the other hand, the pipeline's estimators are all transformers,
          there's a <code>.transform()</code> (and <code>.fit_transform()</code>) methods
          that can be called on it.</p>
        <p>Pipelines return numpy arrays. To recover the DataFrame object, pass the
          pipeline's output along to <code>pd.DataFrame(pipeline_output, columns=pipeline.get_features_names_out(), index=numerical_data.index)</code> -
          in which <code>pipeline_output = pipeline.fit_transform(numerical_data)</code>.</p>
        <p>So far, we have dealt with numerical and categorical columns (attributes)
          separately. Fortunately, there's <code>sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer</code> class
          (with the help of <code>sklearn.compose.make_column_selector</code>), which
          let's you handle both at the same time. Also, if you don't care for the
          naming of the transformers, use <code>sklearn.compose.make_column_transformer</code>: <code>preprocessing = make_column_transformer((num_pipeline, make_column_selector(dtype_include=np.number)), (cat_pipeline, make_column_selector(dtype_include=object)))</code>.</p>
