        <p>These are used when the object belongs to the subject.</p>
        <p>In English, one can say “he loves his book” (which can mean that a guy
          loves a book he owns or loves a book that some other guy owns) and “he
          loves his own book” (this can only mean that the guy loves a book he owns).</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>In Norwegian, however, “han elsker hans bok” (and “han elsker boken hans”,
          for that matter) only means that a guy loves a book owned by another guy.
          If one wants to say that someone does something to a thing they own, the
          correct form is using the refleksive possessive form, like so: “han elsker
          sin bok”/ “han elsker boken sin” ("he loves his [own] book").</p>
