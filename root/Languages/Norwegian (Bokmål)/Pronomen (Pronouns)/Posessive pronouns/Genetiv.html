        <p>Genetiv is one of the ways to express possession in Norwegian. It basically
          consists in adding an “s” at the end of the word (the possessor). The noun
          must always be in the indefinite form (independently of singular/ plural).</p>
        <p>For instance: “Alexs <a href="../../Subsantiver%20(Nouns)/Things/en%20bok%20(a%20book)">bok</a>”
          means “Alex's book”.</p>
        <p>The only difference to English is the fact that Norwegian will only add
          an apostrophe when the word already ends with an “s”.</p>
        <p>For instance: "Sveits' flagg" (Switzerland's flag).</p>
