         <h2>Def. plural</h2>

        <p>The definite plural form convention is the way of defining plural <a href="../../../../Subsantiver%20(Nouns)">nouns</a>.
          It basically consist in pluralizing the noun and replacing the “er” ending
          with the letters “ene” or “ne” - if the noun already ends in “e” or “r”
          (or even “a” if the noun is <a href="../../../../Artikler%20(Articles)/List/Et.html">neutral</a>,
          even though the first is more common).</p>
        <p>For instance: “<a href="../../../Animals%20%20%20%20(Dyr)/en%20katt%20(a%20cat)">katt</a>”
          means “cat”, while “kattene” means “the cats”. There are, however, irregular
          plural nouns, like “<a href="../../../People/en%20mann%20(a%20man)">mann</a>”
          ("man"), which becomes “mennene” ("men").</p>
