      <div class="ck-content">
        <p>“til” is “more” in the sense of “one more”.</p>
        <p>If you want more of something countable, you can use the adverb "til".
          You then combine it with a number: “en til” becomes “one more” or “another”,
          “to til” becomes “two more”, and so on.</p>
        <p>When specifying exactly what you want, by adding a noun, the number goes
          before the noun, while “til” goes after, like so: “<a href="../Artikler%20(Articles)/List/En.html">en</a> 
          <a
          href="../Subsantiver%20(Nouns)/Things/en%20kopp%20(a%20cup)">kopp</a>til” ("one more cup").</p>
