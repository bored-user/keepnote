# notes

Here are the notes I take. I currently use [Trilium Notes](https://github.com/zadam/trilium) as my note-taking application. Everytime now and then, I export the root note and commit it here (I should do that more often lol).
Many thanks to [@zadam](https://github.com/zadam) for making this wonderful application :)

In order to import my notes, you must zip all files into a zip archive and import it in Trilium.
