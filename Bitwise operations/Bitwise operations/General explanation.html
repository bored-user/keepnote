    <p>Bitwise operations basically executes the true/ false checks on each bit
      of the given number.</p>
    <p>In order to understand it, one must comprehend binary terms. Roughly speaking,
      every information is stored on binary (0 or 1). A set of 8 binary numbers
      (aka bit) is called a <i>byte</i>. A bitwise operation executes the specified
      operation in all bits of the number.</p>
    <p>All bitwise operations (except for bitwise NOT) perform upon an operand
      and an operator and generate a third number as a result.</p>
    <p>Note: 1 = true and 0 = false.</p>
