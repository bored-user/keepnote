     <h1>Auto-implemented properties</h1>

    <p>Auto-implemented properties are an easier way to write getters and setters.
      Instead of doing <code>GetX</code> and <code>SetX</code> for a <code>X</code> properties
      defined, one can simply use <code>public int X { get; set; }</code> and voila.
      C# compiler automatically defines the private field and the (public) property.</p>
    <p>Every (private) field should have a (public) property that modify/ read
      it. As mentioned <a href="../../Property%20vs%20Field.html">here</a>, when
      no further validation will take place, auto-implemented properties are
      more than welcome.</p>
    <p>Finally, one can implement access modifiers on getters and setters.</p>
